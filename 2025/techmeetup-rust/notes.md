- whoami
- governance, maintenance & development, deployment of Rust

## Governance
- what is governance
- forms of language government
  - company-backed (Kotlin/C#/TypeScript?)
  - design by committee (C/C++/Javascript)
  - BDFL (Ruby/Zig/ex-Python)
  - Open RFC process (Rust/PHP/Python - steering council)
- Rust governance history
  - Graydon BDFL
  - core team
  - RFC process, teams
  - Rust Foundation
- structure of the Project
  - people of the Rust Project
  - team structure
  - Rust Foundation (legal entity, bank account, infrastructure, domain ownership, sponsorship)
- team database
- how to change Rust?
  - small change => PR
  - large/language change => RFC
- making decisions
    - consensus
    - FCP
    - invest most time => make decisions?

- handling conflict
    - great int debate, no new rationale
        - await, not follow the results of the survey
    - trademark drama, mod team resignation, RustConf drama
    - transparency
    - CrabLang
    - code of conduct
    - people care a lot about Rust, it feels improbable
    - slide with all the dramas

- thanks.rust-lang.org

- communication
    - OSS is communication, screenshot of my GitHub profile
    - mailing lists => not inclusive (Linux)
    - IRC
    - Zulip (publicly accessible), Discord, GitHub
    - asynchronous communication, different time-zones
    - who gets to decide what gets done? Project Goals

- RFCs
    - can be submitted by anyone!

- teams
    - stats
    - team database
    - invite people early (show my invitation into wg-compiler-perf and t-infra), avoid gatekeeping
    - teams are autonomous and independent

- complex distributed system
    - asynchronous
    - no one tells people what to work on

## Maintenance
- OSS
    - screwdriver
    - curl list of things that form maintenance
- show rust-lang/rust and other repositories, issue/PR counts
- bots
    - triagebot => welcome contributors
    - bors => delegate r+

- onboarding, developing both external and internal documentation
    - The Rust Programming Language book
    - rustc-dev-guide
- contributor stats from GitHub

## Deployment
- new release every six weeks
  - release train, avoid stress
  - breaking changes
  - crater
  - edition model

## How can you contribute to your language
- GSoC
- nerd-sniping
- summarize the current state
- post an issue
- write a blog post
- send a PR (if possible)

- consider sponsoring OSS developers
  - thanks.dev
  - GitHub Sponsors
